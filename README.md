**A simple web application to connect local food producers with consumers in Switzerland.**

Localps is a project aimed at providing a platform for local food producers in Switzerland to advertise their products and for customers to easily find local food sources. The goal is to create a user-friendly and lightweight application that supports local businesses and promotes sustainable food consumption.

This project is built using the JavaScript runtime [Deno](https://deno.land/) and the web framework [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/).

The software is open-sourced under the [MIT License](LICENSE) for transparency. While active collaboration is not the primary focus, the project is publicly available for anyone interested.
